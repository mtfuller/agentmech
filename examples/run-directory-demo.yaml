      The run directory for this workflow execution is: {{run_directory}}
      
      This directory is unique for each run and will contain:
      - trace.log (if tracing is enabled)
      - run-metadata.json (workflow metadata)
      - Any files created by the workflow
      
      The filesystem MCP server has been automatically configured to use this directory,
      so you can read and write files to this location.
      
      Please acknowledge this information.

      Create a simple text file called "output.txt" in the current directory with the content:
      "This file was created during workflow execution at {{run_directory}}"
      
      Use the filesystem tools to write this file.

      Now read the content of the "output.txt" file you just created and confirm its contents.

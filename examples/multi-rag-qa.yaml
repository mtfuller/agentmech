      - named: Uses named RAG configs from 'rags:' section with 'use_rag: "name"'
      - inline: Uses state-level inline 'rag:' configuration
      - all: Demonstrates all three approaches in sequence

      1. Named RAG for products: {{product_answer}}
      2. Named RAG for technical: {{technical_answer}}
      3. Inline RAG: {{inline_answer}}
